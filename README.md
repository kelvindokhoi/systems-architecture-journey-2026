# Systems Architecture & High-Performance Journey (2026)

🚀 **The Mission:** A 360-day intensive roadmap to transition from competitive programming (Kattis Top 1000) to High-Performance Systems Engineering. This repository tracks my daily algorithm mastery and the development of four "AI-proof" core infrastructure projects.

## 📊 Performance Metrics
* **Kattis Global Rank:** ~1000
* **CCSC Competition:** 2nd Place
* **Daily Streak:** [https://github.com/users/kelvindokhoi/projects/2]
* **Primary Stack:** Rust, Go, TypeScript, PostgreSQL

## 🗺️ The 12-Month Roadmap

### Phase 1: Networking & Graph Logic (Jan - Apr)
**Focus:** Mastering the OSI model, TCP/IP, and asynchronous networking in Go and Rust.
* **Kattis Focus:** Graph Theory, Max Flow, and Network Routing.
* **Featured Project:** `mini-redis-rs` — A high-performance, asynchronous Key-Value store built with Rust and Tokio.

### Phase 2: Systems, Memory & Kernel Logic (Apr - Jul)
**Focus:** Low-level memory management, bitwise optimization, and process scheduling.
* **Kattis Focus:** Bitmasking, Simulation, and Priority Queues.
* **Featured Project:** `oxide-ssg` — A blazingly fast Static Site Generator optimized for I/O performance.

### Phase 3: Distributed Systems & Scalability (Jul - Oct)
**Focus:** Consensus algorithms, data replication, and CAP theorem.
* **Kattis Focus:** Advanced Data Structures (Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees).
* **Featured Project:** `p2p-share-go` — A peer-to-peer file-sharing protocol using DHT for discovery.

### Phase 4: Specialization & Deep Tech (Oct - Jan)
**Focus:** Database internals, B-Trees, and memory-safe cryptography.
* **Kattis Focus:** Computational Geometry and Number Theory.
* **Featured Project:** `lsm-engine-rs` — A Log-Structured Merge-tree storage engine built from scratch.

## 🛠️ Project Management
I manage this journey using a **GitHub Project (Kanban)** linked to this repository. Every Kattis solution is submitted as a Pull Request and linked to an Issue to maintain a professional engineering workflow.
